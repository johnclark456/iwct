The city dog pounds in the Philippines are in need of drastic improvement and we have embarked upon a programme, working with the individual pounds! The first thing we did was to provide the Manila pound with good quality dog food and new food and water bowls for the residents. We then took 11 of the pound dogs back to our Rescue Centre to begin a course of veterinary treatment, neutering and rehabilitation.  All of the dogs were malnourished, sickly and had been wasting away in the pound, sadly 2 of the dogs were too poorly and didn't make it but for the other 9 it has been a very different tale.</p><p>After five months of treatment, good food and lots of love at the Rescue Centre, the 9 dogs all given names beginning with A, have all found new homes. As part of our agreement with the dog pound, we returned to Manila with the 9 healthy dogs and held an Askal Day, where local people were able to bring their dogs for free vaccination and neutering. It was also an opportunity for prospective new owners to meet the 9 dogs that were being offered for adoption, with all of our usual adoption guidelines and checks in place, and we are delighted to report that Abbey, Andrea and the other 7 A's have all found loving new homes.</p></div></div><figure class=\"col-md-6 col-md-offset-3\"><img src=\"img_resp/Andrea_adopted-medium.jpg\" srcset=\"img_resp/Andrea_adopted-small.jpg 320w, img_resp/Andrea_adopted-medium.jpg 640w, img_resp/Andrea_adopted-large.jpg 1024w\"></figure>"

We were also very fortunate to have Dame Judi Dench in the audience, helping raise awareness of this horrific practice. We are thrilled that Judi has also just agreed to become a patron of IWCT.</p><p>The session was an MP's briefing led by John McDonnell MP who, having become aware of the dog meat trade, supported an early day motion in parliament last year, calling for an immediate end to the dog meat trade, which has so far received a phenomenal 136  signatures, a great sign that MP's are willing to help!</p></div> </div><div class=\"row\"><figure class=\"col-md-6 img-responsive img-flow pull-left\"><img src=\"img_resp/150128WST-133-medium.jpg\" srcset=\"img_resp/150128WST-133-small.jpg 320w, img_resp/150128WST-133-medium.jpg 640w, img_resp/150128WST-133-large.jpg 1024w\"><figcaption>John Hawkridge, IWCT Trustee, Peter Egan, John McDonnell MP &amp; Tobias Ellwood MP<br><span class=\"copy\">Image &copy; Philip Durrant</span></figcaption></figure><div class=\"col-md-12\"><p>The audience was also shown two short films about the trade, which provided harrowing but moving viewing and included the Soi Dog film \"I didn't know\" featuring Ricky Gervais, Peter Egan,  Judi Dench and stars of Downtown Abbey!

The Dogs Trust carers were able to introduce methods to specifically help dogs acclimatise to new surroundings and help them relax in the presence of different people, in order to start building up a trust between dog and kennelmate. They were also able to demonstrate some new procedures for handling jealousy amongst rescued dogs, in order to avoid fighting and constant barking. We were able to begin placing camera's in kennels overnight in order to observe the dogs behaviour and that way identify those that might need more exercise and stimulation during the day, as a result of observing agitated behaviour at night.</p><p>The Dogs Trust carers also worked with our kennelmates to introduce new toys and treats for the dogs, using recycled items such as water bottles and egg trays, stimulating the dogs senses using spices and cooling dogs down during intense heat using Ice Pop treats. It was also an opportunity to show the carers our new tyre play area, developed as a result of the previous Dogs Trust placement, in 2013.</p></div></div><figure class=\"img-responsive col-md-offset-2 col-md-8\"><img src=\"img_resp/DSCF1125-medium.JPG\" srcset=\"img_resp/DSCF1125-small.JPG 320w, img_resp/DSCF1125-medium.JPG 640w, img_resp/DSCF1125-large.JPG 1024w\"></figure><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-12\"><p>During their visit the 3 Dogs Trust carers accompanied our veterinary team on one of our Askal Day in the local community, when we carry out free neutering, vaccination and worming of dogs.</p><p>Following the visit our Centre staff are incredibly indebted to Amanda, Emir and Kirsty for all that they taught them and can't wait to start adopting the methods demonstrated.</p></div></div>"

In general these pounds leave a lot to be desired, they are often overcrowded, dirty and what food the dogs are given is of very poor quality. Most importantly if a dog is not claimed within 7 days of arriving at the pound it is put to sleep.</p><p>As a result we are determined to take these pounds on and we've started by visiting a dog pound in Manila, who have agreed, with our help, to make some much needed improvements, which began with us supplying them with some decent dog food and new food &amp; water bowls. On our second visit we agreed to take 11 of the pound dogs back to our Rescue Centre, where they received necessary veterinary and vaccination treatment and were neutered.

They discovered tools for capturing and killing dogs and it was later confirmed that the farm’s practice was to slaughter dogs alongside goats, mix up the meat of both animals and sell it on.</p></div><div class=\"col-md-6\"><figure><img src=img_resp/news/Craig_caged-medium.jpg srcset=\"img_resp/news/Craig_caged-small.jpg 320w, img_resp/news/Craig_caged-medium.jpg 640w, img_resp/news/Craig_caged-large.jpg 1024w\"></figure></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-12\"><p>The owner of the farm turned out to be the village chief and he, together with his father and the farm’s caretaker have had 4 separate cases of animal welfare violations, consumer act, meat inspection bureau’s code violation and anti rabies act filed against them. AKF, working alongside PNP, have now taken the 11 surviving dogs to the Rescue Centre in Capas where they will spend a minimum of two months in the recovery pen. There they will receive full physical and social rehabilitation before being put into the re-homing scheme with the hope of adoption into new loving homes.</p></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-6\"><figure><img src=img_resp/news/Laguna_Dogs_arrival-medium.jpg srcset=\"img_resp/news/Laguna_Dogs_arrival-small.jpg 320w, img_resp/news/Laguna_Dogs_arrival-medium.jpg 640w, img_resp/news/Laguna_Dogs_arrival-large.jpg 1024w\"></figure></div><div class=\"col-md-6\"><figure><img src=img_resp/news/Laguna_Dogs_arrival_2-medium.jpg srcset=\"img_resp/news/Laguna_Dogs_arrival_2-small.jpg 320w, img_resp/news/Laguna_Dogs_arrival_2-medium.jpg 640w, img_resp/news/Laguna_Dogs_arrival_2-large.jpg 1024w\"></figure></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-12\"><p>These are a few photos of the rescued dogs beginning their rehabilitation back at the Centre, look out for news of their recovery in the coming weeks!</p></div></div>"
