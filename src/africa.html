					<p>We are excited to tell you about a project that we are hoping to get involved with in the coming months.</p>

					<p>Back in 1995, The George Adamson Wildlife Preservation Trust, based in Tanzania, began a captive breeding and translocation programme for the critically endangered African Wild Dog, in order to restore their rapidly diminishing numbers.</p>

					<p>“African Wild Dogs are the wolves of Africa, a vanishing species, mysterious, elusive and constantly moving packs, they possess no territories; only when the alpha female whelps does the pack settle down for a few months until the pups are old enough to travel.</p>

					<p>For years they were despised as vermin, shot and poisoned by farmers, hunters and gamers. Condemned as livestock killers, they became fugitives, their numbers gradually depleting and it's only in recent years that more enlightened attitudes began to appear, with the African Wild Dog being seen, not as an indiscriminate butcher, but as a highly intelligent social animal, whose hunting efficiency actually improves the quality of game animals by removing sick individuals and scattering herds to prevent inbreeding.”</p>

					<p>Sadly, this change came too late to save many packs and despite the protection of parks and reserves, their numbers continued to decline with disease and poisoning being the prime causes. </p>

					<p>When this reintroduction programme first began there were fewer than 3,000 wild dogs in the whole of Africa.  Today there are estimated to be over 5,500, with numbers increasing in certain areas where programmes have been put in place.  Sightings of wild dogs in the Tsavo National Park / Mkomazi National Park ecosystem have increased over the past ten years.</p>

					<p>An endangered species programme such as this can only be successful if there is continuity and perseverance over many years and to this end the George Adamson Wildlife Preservation Trust has continued to manage the breeding and release of these wild dogs, following the systems established over the last 20 years.</p>

					<p>Watch out for more information about this fascinating and endangered species and how we are hoping to become involved in their re-establishment.</p>
